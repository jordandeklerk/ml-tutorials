## Overview <a id="overview" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

Amortized variational inference (A-VI) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of Bayesian deep generative models. In this project, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of A-VI in closing the amortization gap between A-VI and traditional variational inference methods, such as factorized variational inference (F-VI), or mean-field variational inference. We conduct numerical experiments on benchmark imaging datasets to compare the performance of A-VI with varying neural network architectures against F-VI and constant-VI.

Our findings demonstrate that A-VI, when implemented with sufficiently deep neural networks, can achieve the same evidence lower bound (ELBO) and reconstruction mean squared error (MSE) as F-VI while being 2 to 3 times computationally faster. These results highlight the potential of A-VI in addressing the amortization interpolation problem and suggest that a deep encoder-decoder linear neural network with full Bayesian inference over the latent variables can effectively approximate an ideal inference function. This work paves the way for more efficient and scalable Bayesian deep generative models.

## Introduction <a id="introduction" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

In the Bayesian paradigm, statistical inference regarding unknown variables is predicated on computations involving posterior probability densities. Due to the often intractable nature of these densities, which typically lack an analytic form, estimation becomes crucial. Classical methods for estimating the posterior distribution in Bayesian inference such as MCMC are known to be computationally expensive at test time as they rely on repeated evaluations of the likelihood function and, therefore, require a new set of likelihood evaluations for each observation. In contrast, Variational Inference (VI) offers a compelling solution by recasting the difficult task of estimating complex posterior densities into a more manageable optimization problem. The essence of VI lies in selecting a parameterized distribution family, $\mathcal{Q}$, and identifying the member that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the posterior

$$
\begin{equation}
q^* = \arg \min _{q \in \mathcal{Q}} \mathrm{KL}(q(\theta, \mathbf{z}) \| p(\theta, \mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x})).
\end{equation}
$$

This process enables the approximation of the posterior with $q^*$, thereby delineating the VI objective to entail the selection of an appropriate variational family $\mathcal{Q}$ for optimization. Common practice in VI applications involves the adoption of the factorized, or mean-field, family. This family is characterized by the independence of the variables

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{Q}_{\mathrm{F}}=\left\{q: q(\theta, \mathbf{z})=q_0(\theta) \prod_{n=1}^N q_n\left(z_n\right)\right\},
\end{equation}
$$

wherein each latent variable is represented by a distinct factor $q_n$.

Contrary to the VI framework, the amortized family $\mathcal{Q}_{\mathrm{A}}$ leverages a stochastic inference function $f_{\phi}(x_n)$ to dictate the variational distribution of each latent variable $z_n$, typically instantiated through a neural network, facilitating the parameter mapping for each latent variable's approximating factor $q_n(z_n)$ (Ankush):

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{Q}_{\mathrm{A}}=\left\{q: q(\theta, \mathbf{z})=q_0(\theta) \prod_{n=1}^N q\left(z_n ; f_\phi\left(x_n\right)\right)\right\}.
\end{equation}
$$

This paradigm, known as _amortized variational inference_ (A-VI), optimizes the approximation of the posterior and the inference function simultaneously. Therefore, inference on a single observation can be performed efficiently through a single forward pass through the neural network, framing Bayesian inference as a prediction problem: for _any_ observation, the neural network is trained to predict the posterior distribution, or a quantity that allows the network to infer the posterior without any further simulations.

## Background <a id="background" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) belong to a category of machine learning models known as latent variable models. These models operate on the principle that the observable characteristics of data can be derived from a set of underlying, unobservable variables, termed as latent variables. The essence of VAEs is to circumvent the direct construction of a latent space. Instead, these models employ an Encoder-Decoder architecture to access this space indirectly.

<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="./images/amortized-bayes/vae.png" alt="Variational Autoencoder Architecture">
  <figcaption style="margin-top: 10px; color: gray;">Figure 1: The architecture of a Variational Autoencoder</figcaption>
</figure>

<br><br>

From Figure 1, we can see that this architecture is split into two major components:

- The **encoder** component of a VAE constructs a distribution based on the input data. This distribution is utilized to infer latent variables that are likely responsible for producing the input data. In technical terms, the encoder learns a set of parameters $\theta_1$, which define a distribution $Q(x, \theta_1)$. From this distribution, latent variables are sampled that maximize the probability of the observed data, represented as $\mathbb{P}(\mathbf{X}|\mathbf{z})$.
- The **decoder** component takes these inferred latent variables and generates data that aligns with the actual observed distribution of the dataset. It uses the latent variables sampled by the encoder as inputs. Specifically, the decoder learns another set of parameters, $\theta_2$, that map these latent variables back to the original data distribution through a function $f(\mathbf{z}, \theta_2)$.

In essence, VAEs model the process of data generation through encoding to and decoding from a latent space, aiming to produce outputs that closely approximate the true distribution of the data.

### Inference in Variational Autoencoders <a id="inference-in-variational-autoencoders" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

Consider $x$ as the observed variable, \(z\) as the hidden variable, and $p(x, z)$ representing their joint distribution. For a dataset $X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N\}$, our goal is to maximize the marginal $\log$-likelihood with respect to the model parameters $\theta$, expressed as

$$
\log p_\theta(X) = \sum_{i=1}^N \log p_\theta(x_i) = \sum_{i=1}^N \log \int p_\theta(x_i, z_i) \, dz_i.
$$

However, calculating the marginal log-likelihood directly is not feasible due to the integral over the hidden variable $z$. To address this, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) employ an inference network $q_\phi(z | x)$ as an approximation to the actual posterior $p(z | x)$ and optimize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) relative to both the model parameters $\theta$ and the parameters $\phi$ of the inference network:

$$
\log p(x) = \mathbb{E}_{q(z | x)}\left[\log \left(\frac{p(x, z)}{q(z | x)}\right)\right] + \text{KL}(q(z | x) \| p(z | x)) \geq \mathbb{E}_{q(z | x)}\left[\log \left(\frac{p(x, z)}{q(z | x)}\right)\right] = \mathcal{L}_{\text{VAE}}[q].
$$

The ELBO is equivalent to the true log likelihood when $q(z | x) = p(z | x)$. Typically, $q(z | x)$ is chosen to be a factorized Gaussian for its simplicity and computational efficiency. VAEs leverage the inference network (also known as the encoder or recognition network) to generalize inference across the entire dataset efficiently. The model is trained by stochastically optimizing the ELBO through the reparametrization trick, introduced by Kingma.

### The Reparameterization Trick <a id="the-reparameterization-trick" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

The reparametrization trick was initially introduced in [Kingma](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114). It is important to understand this trick because we need a way to generate samples from $q_{\theta}(z | x)$. Our explanation here follows [this great post](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2018/04/29/reparameterization/) very closely.

<figure style="text-align: center;">

#### Non-differentiable Expectations <a id="non-differentiable-expectations" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

Consider the scenario where we need to compute the gradient concerning $\theta$ for the expectation,

$$
\mathbb{E}_{p(z)}[f_\theta(z)]
$$

Here, $p$ represents a probability density. Assuming that $f_\theta(z)$ is differentiable, the computation of the gradient becomes straightforward:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_\theta \mathbb{E}_{p(z)}[f_\theta(z)] &= \nabla_\theta\left[\int_z p(z) f_\theta(z) \, dz\right] \\
&= \int_z p(z)\left[\nabla_\theta f_\theta(z)\right] \, dz \\
&= \mathbb{E}_{p(z)}[\nabla_\theta f_\theta(z)].
\end{aligned}
$$

In essence, the gradient of the expectation equals the expectation of the gradient. However, complications arise if the density $p$ also depends on $\theta$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_\theta \mathbb{E}_{p_\theta(z)}[f_\theta(z)] &= \nabla_\theta\left[\int_z p_\theta(z) f_\theta(z) \, dz\right] \\
&= \int_z \nabla_\theta\left[p_\theta(z) f_\theta(z)\right] \, dz \\
&= \int_z f_\theta(z) \nabla_\theta p_\theta(z) \, dz + \int_z p_\theta(z) \nabla_\theta f_\theta(z) \, dz \\
&= \underbrace{\int_z f_\theta(z) \nabla_\theta p_\theta(z) \, dz}_{\text{How about this part?}} + \mathbb{E}_{p_\theta(z)}[\nabla_\theta f_\theta(z)].
\end{aligned}
$$

The initial part of the final equation doesn't necessarily equate to an expectation. While Monte Carlo techniques allow sampling from $p_\theta(z)$, they do not ensure the gradient of this sampling process is obtainable. This poses no issue if there exists an analytic solution for $\nabla_\theta p_\theta(z)$, but such a solution is not always available.

With a clearer understanding of the challenge, let's explore the application of the reparameterization trick to our example. Following Kingma's notation, vectors are denoted in bold, $\mathbf{v}^{(i)}$ represents the $i$-th sample of vector $\mathbf{v}$, and $l \in L$ signifies the $l$-th Monte Carlo sample. The reparameterization trick is utilized to shift from a gradient of an expectation to an expectation of a gradient, facilitating the use of Monte Carlo estimations for gradients involving expectations. This transition is pivotal, especially when the function $g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ is differentiable, a point that Kingma underscores. The mathematical flow is as follows:

1. Noise variables $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ are drawn from a predefined distribution $p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})$.
2. These variables, along with input $\mathbf{x}$, are transformed by $g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ to obtain $\mathbf{z}$.
3. The expectation with respect to $p_\theta(\mathbf{z})$ is equated to an expectation with respect to $p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})$, leveraging the function $g_\theta$.
4. Subsequently, the gradient of the expectation with respect to $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is expressed and approximated via Monte Carlo sampling.

Formally, this can be represented as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{\epsilon} & \sim p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}) \\
\mathbf{z} & =g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \mathbf{x}) \\
\mathbb{E}_{p_\theta(\mathbf{z})}\left[f\left(\mathbf{z}^{(i)}\right)\right] & =\mathbb{E}_{p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})}\left[f\left(g_\theta\left(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)}\right)\right)\right] \\
\nabla_\theta \mathbb{E}_{p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})}\left[f\left(\mathbf{z}^{(i)}\right)\right] & =\nabla_\theta \mathbb{E}_{p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})}\left[f\left(g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)}\right)\right)\right] \\
& =\mathbb{E}_{p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})}\left[\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} f\left(g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)}\right)\right)\right] \\
& \approx \frac{1}{L} \sum_{l=1}^L \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} f\left(g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\epsilon^{(l)}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)}\right)\right).
\end{aligned}
$$

It's important to emphasize that this explanation aligns with Kingma's reasoning. The challenge isn't technically about the inability to backpropagate through a "random node". The issue is more about backpropagation not providing an estimate of the derivative. Without employing the reparameterization trick, there's no assurance that sampling a large number of $\mathbf{z}$ values will lead to a correct estimate of $\nabla_{\theta}$.

Moreover, this issue directly relates to the problem we encounter with estimating the ELBO. We see that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{ELBO}(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\phi}) & = \mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z})}\left[\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) - \log q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x})\right], \\
& \downarrow \\
\nabla_{\theta, \phi} \text{ELBO}(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\phi}) & = \nabla_{\theta, \phi}\left[\mathbb{E}_{q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z})}\left[\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) - \log q_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x})\right]\right].
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the equation above doesn't quite resemble what is computed in a standard VAE. In his paper, Kingma introduces two estimators, denoted as $\mathcal{L}^A$ and $\mathcal{L}^B$. The equation for $\mathcal{L}^A$ is shown above, while $\mathcal{L}^B$ applies when there's an analytic solution for the KL-divergence term in the ELBO, such as when assuming Gaussian distributions for both the prior $p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})$ and the posterior approximation $q_{\phi}(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{x})$:

$$
\nabla_{\theta, \phi} \mathcal{L}^B = -\nabla_{\theta, \phi} \left[\text{KL}\left[q_{\phi}(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x}^{(i)}) \| p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z})\right]\right] + \nabla_{\theta, \phi} \left[\frac{1}{L} \sum_{l=1}^L \log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)} \mid \mathbf{z}^{(l)})\right].
$$

Now, with the capability to compute the full loss through a series of differentiable operations, gradient-based optimization techniques can be applied to maximize the ELBO.

#### Implementation <a id="implementation" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

Closing the loop with implementation details, the standard VAE follows the equation derived by Kingma for the KL term in Appendix 2. This equation presents the model with the likelihood as a "decoder" and the approximate posterior as an "encoder"

$$
\mathcal{L}^B = -\text{KL}\left[q_\phi(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x}^{(i)}) \| p_\theta(\mathbf{z})\right] + \frac{1}{L} \sum_{l=1}^L \log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)} \mid \mathbf{z}^{(l)}).
$$

This can be understood as follows: the KL-divergence term encourages the encoder's output to resemble the fixed prior distribution $p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})$. Ideally, if the encoder perfectly captures both the real posterior and the prior, Bayes' rule would imply $p(\mathbf{x})=p(\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{z})$, aligning with the objectives of a generative model. Through the reparameterization trick, we can sample $\mathbf{z}$ and conditionally generate realistic samples of $\mathbf{x}$.

A single computational graph pass for Gaussian priors and posteriors might look like the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{\mu}_x, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_x & = \text{Encoder}(\mathbf{x}) & & \quad \text{Push $\mathbf{x}$ through encoder} \\
\boldsymbol{\epsilon} & \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1) & & \quad \text{Sample noise} \\
\mathbf{z} & = \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \boldsymbol{\sigma}_x + \boldsymbol{\mu}_x & & \quad \text{Reparameterize} \\
\mathbf{x}_r & = \text{Decoder}(\mathbf{z}) & & \quad \text{Push $\mathbf{z}$ through decoder} \\
\text{Recon. Loss} & = \text{MSE}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}_r) & & \quad \text{Compute reconstruction loss} \\
\text{Var. Loss} & = -\text{KL}\left[\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_x, \boldsymbol{\sigma}_x^2) \| \mathcal{N}(0, I)\right] & & \quad \text{Compute variational loss} \\
\text{Total Loss} & = \text{Recon. Loss} + \text{Var. Loss} & & \quad \text{Combine losses}
\end{aligned}
$$

By computing each variable in this graph through differentiable operations, backpropagation can be applied to compute gradients.

## Theoretical Preliminaries <a id="theoretical-preliminaries" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

To comprehend when A-VI can narrow the difference with F-VI, we initially consider that the variational families in Eqs. 2 and 3 employ the identical initial distribution $q_0(\theta)$. This allows us to concentrate on the characteristics of the variational distributions for $z_n$.

Recall, in F-VI, each local latent variable $z_n$ is described by a marginal distribution $q_n(z_n ; \nu_n)$ from a parametric family $\mathcal{O}_{l}$, where $\nu_n$ belongs to the parameter space $\,\mathcal{U}$. The complete family, or mean-field family, $\mathcal{Q}_F$ is defined as the product of these marginals

$$
q_0(\theta) \prod_{n=1}^N q_n(z_n ; \nu_n).
$$

We determine the best variational parameters $\nu^* = (\nu_0^*, \nu_1^*, \ldots, \nu_N^*)$ by minimizing the KL-divergence shown in Eq. 1.

<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="./images/amortized-bayes/avi.png" alt="A-VI explanation">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

Assuming $\mathcal{X}$ represents the space of $x_n$, A-VI approximates a function $f_{\phi}: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{U}$ across a set of inference functions $\mathcal{F}$, each parameterized by $\phi$. We also minimize the KL-divergence in Eq. 1 with respect to $\phi$ to derive the optimal variational family $\mathcal{Q}_A(\mathcal{F})$. Clearly from Eq. 2 and Eq. 3, $\mathcal{Q}_A(\mathcal{F})$ is a subset of $\mathcal{Q}_F$. This subset relationship is exemplified by considering $x_n = x_m$, which implies $f_{\phi}(x_n) = f_{\phi}(x_m)$, whereas a potential distribution $\tilde{q}(\theta, z) \in \mathcal{Q}_F$ could have $\nu_n \neq \nu_m$, confirming a strict subset.

This subset relation means A-VI cannot theoretically surpass F-VI in achieving a lower KL-divergence, leading to what is known as the _amortization gap_. To bridge this gap, the inference function $f_{\phi}$ must interpolate between $x_n$ and the optimal variational parameter $\nu_n^*$, represented by

$$
f_{\phi}(x_n) = \nu_n^*, \quad \forall n.
$$

Addressing this requirement is termed the _amortization interpolation problem_. Any function $f$ that resolves this is called an _ideal inference function_. Conditions can be set on the model $p(\theta, z, x)$ ensuring the feasibility of the ideal inference function, thereby making the amortization interpolation problem well-posed. Once the existence of an ideal inference function is established, we can explore the necessary complexity of the family of inference functions $\mathcal{F}$ to include such an ideal $f$, although this exploration is beyond the scope of this post.

In the following section, we will practically investigate the amortization interpolation problem through numerical experiments, demonstrating that a deep encoder-decoder linear neural network with full Bayesian inference on latent variables can approximate this ideal inference function and mitigate the amortization gap.

## Numerical Experiments <a id="numerical-experiments" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

### Experimental Setup <a id="experimental-setup" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

We use a family of factorized Gaussians as the variational approximation. We will compare A-VI against the benchmark methods F-VI and constant-VI, which assigns the same factor $\bar{q}$ to each latent variable $z_n$. Note that, as established earlier, F-VI is the richest variational family while it should be clear that constant-VI is comparatively the poorest variational family. We will implement A-VI with neural networks with various degrees of complexity, which in this case, corresponds to varying hidden dimensions.

We optimize the KL-divergence by maximizing the evidence lower-bound (ELBO),

$$
\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{z}, \theta ; \nu)} [\log p(\theta, \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x}) - \log q(\theta, \mathbf{z})],
$$

which is estimated via Monte Carlo with a mini-batching strategy that will be described in detail in the next section.

In all of our experiments, we employ the Adam optimizer in PyTorch using the reparameterization trick to calculate the gradients. We use a learning rate of 1e-3 with weight decay of 1e-1, and train the model for 5,000 epochs. Experiments are naturally stochastic, so we repeat each numerical experiment across 5 different seeds and find that the initial results are stable. We ran these experiments on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU in Google Colab. Training time for `MNIST` and `FashionMNIST` takes less than 2 hours. Training time for `CIFAR-10` takes much longer in comparison (over 8 hours).

**Bayesian Deep Generative Model**

We explore a deep generative model on two standard image datasets, `MNIST` and `FashionMNIST`. In our model, each image is represented by a low-dimensional latent vector $\mathbf{z}_n \in \mathbb{R}^{64}$, modeled with the probability distribution

$$
p(\mathbf{x_n} | \mathbf{z_n}, \theta) = \mathcal{N}(\Omega(\mathbf{z_n}; \theta), \mathbb{I}),
$$

where $\Omega$ is a linear neural network consisting of two hidden layers with varying sizes (64, 128, 256), and uses leaky ReLU activations. The neural network parameters $\theta$ include all the weights and biases. This model is a variant of the standard VAE but incorporates a Bayesian approach to estimating a posterior distribution over $\theta$, which helps in addressing the amortization gap often observed in such models. For practicality and due to computational limits, we trained our model on 10,000 images from each dataset using full-batch training. During training, we assessed the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) on a mini-batch of 1,000 images ten times per epoch.

Let's first import all of the necessary libraries we will be using in this tutorial. We will be working mainly with `torch` and `torchvision`.

We are now ready to establish the configurations for the four datasets we plan to explore. In the following setup, we will define the input dimension (`x_dim`), the hidden dimension (`hidden_dim`), and the latent dimension (`latent_dim`).

- The `x_dim` specifies the size of the input data, which in our context refers to the dimensions of an image. It's important to note that `MNIST`, `FashionMNIST`, and `SVHN` datasets consist of grayscale images, whereas the `CIFAR-10` dataset comprises RGB images.
- The `hidden_dim` indicates the size of the neural network's hidden layers, essentially representing the network's width at each layer.
- Lastly, the `latent_dim` denotes the size of the latent space to which the Encoder compresses the input data, providing a compact representation of the original input.

These configurations are crucial for tailoring our model to effectively handle the specific characteristics of each dataset.

```python
dataset_path = '~/datasets'

dataset_configs = {
    "MNIST": {"x_dim": 28 * 28, "hidden_dim": 400, "latent_dim": 200, "dataset": MNIST},

#### Model Setup <a id="model-setup" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

The encoder is a type of neural network that takes an input, such as a 28x28 pixel image of a handwritten digit (which makes it a 784-dimensional vector), and compresses it into a smaller, or latent, representation denoted as $z$. This process involves learning to reduce the data from its original high dimensionality to a more compact form, often called a "bottleneck," because it forces the network to find an efficient way to represent the data in fewer dimensions. The function of the encoder is captured by $q_\theta(z | x)$, where it actually outputs parameters defining a Gaussian distribution from which we can sample the latent representation $z$.

```python
class Encoder(nn.Module):
    """
    Encoder module for a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), transforming input data into a latent space representation.

    The encoder consists of sequential linear layers with LeakyReLU activations, followed by separate linear layers

    Parameters:
    - input_dim (int): Dimensionality of the input data.
    - hidden_dim (int): Size of the hidden layer(s). This implementation uses two hidden layers of the same size.

On the flip side, the decoder is a complementary neural network that takes the encoded latent representation $z$ and works to reconstruct the original data from it. The decoder is represented by $p_\phi(x | z)$ and aims to output parameters that define the probability distribution of the original data points. Continuing with the handwritten digit example, where each pixel is either black or white, the output distribution for each pixel can be modeled as a Bernoulli distribution. Thus, from a given latent representation $z$, the decoder produces 784 probabilities, corresponding to the 784 pixels, to recreate the image.

The reconstruction process isn't perfect—there's information loss because the decoder operates on a condensed version of the original data. We assess this loss through the reconstruction log-likelihood, $\log p_\phi(x | z)$. This metric evaluates how well the decoder has learned to regenerate an input image $x$ from its encoded version $z$, reflecting the efficiency of the compression and reconstruction process.

```python
def Decoder(theta, z, latent_dim, hidden_dim, x_dim):
    """

#### Training the Model <a id="training-the-model" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

We are now ready to start training our model. This code below trains a given model on provided training data for 5,000 epochs on a subset of 10,000 images, with options for printing output, saving mean squared error (MSE) metrics for both training and testing datasets, and configuring learning rate and weight decay for the optimizer. It initializes the training environment by setting random seeds for reproducibility, and configuring the optimizer.

During training, it computes the loss (negative Evidence Lower Bound, ELBO) for each batch, updates the model parameters through backpropagation, and logs the batch loss. Optionally, it calculates and logs the MSE for the training and, if provided, testing datasets after each epoch. The function returns the trained model, arrays of loss and MSE metrics, and the total training time.

To make the training process easier, we will introduce an experiment wrapper class. This class is designed to be a simple wrapper to conduct our variational inference experiments. It supports experiments with different configurations, including Amortized Variational Inference (A-VI) with neural networks, Mean-Field Variational Inference (F-VI), and Constant Variational Inference (Constant-VI).

The class is structured to handle the entire experimental workflow, which includes initializing models with specific configurations, training these models, running a series of experiments with different settings, and saving the results.

#### Running the Experiments <a id="running-the-experiments" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

Finally, we are ready to conduct our experiments. In this post, we will see the results for the `MNIST` and `FashionMNIST` datasets. However, the results for other datasets are very similar. We can call our experiment wrapper class to start running the experiements and handle all of the heavy lifting for us.

```python
# Begin experiments
experiment = VariationalInferenceExperiment(x,
                                            x_test,
                                            args.z_dim,
                                            args.like_dim,
                                            args.epochs,
                                            args.nn_widths,
                                            args.lr,
                                            args.weight_decay,
                                            args.batch_size,
                                            args.n_obs,
                                            args.dataset,
                                            device)
experiment.run_experiments(args.seed)
```

As we noted earlier, our experiments are inherently stochastic. Therefore, we will run these experiments across several different seeds to confirm our initial results.

```python
# Run experiments across different seeds for robustness
init_seed = 415
for i in range(5):
    seed = init_seed + i
    print("seed: ", seed)
    experiment = VariationalInferenceExperiment(x,
                                            x_test,
                                            args.z_dim,
                                            args.like_dim,
                                            args.epochs,
                                            args.nn_widths,
                                            args.lr,
                                            args.weight_decay,
                                            args.batch_size,
                                            args.n_obs,
                                            args.dataset,
                                            device)
    experiment.run_experiments(seed)
```

### Results <a id="results" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

**MNIST**

Our results, presented in Figure 3 for the MNIST dataset, examine the effects of different network widths and configurations. After 5,000 epochs, our amortized variational inference (A-VI) achieved comparable ELBO values to fixed variational inference (F-VI) with sufficiently deep networks (k ≥ 64). We also evaluated the mean squared error (MSE) for image reconstruction on both the training and testing sets and noted that A-VI effectively bridged the performance gap here too.

Moreover, A-VI proved to be 2 to 3 times faster computationally than F-VI, as seen in Figure 4, underscoring its efficiency in leveraging shared inference computations across data, thus negating the need to estimate unique latent factors $q_n$ for each $z_n$.

<br><br>

**FashionMNIST**

Our results for the `FashionMNIST` experiments are presented in Figure 4 and show the same conclusions as the `MNIST` experiments.

</figure>

<br><br>

We also see a similar increase in computational speed on the `FashionMNIST` dataset as shown in Figure 5.

</figure>

<br><br>

In Figure 6, we present reconstructed images for a sample of five original images from the `MNIST` and `FashionMNIST` datasets. It’s important to note that these reconstructions, produced using a linear neural network, exhibit lower visual quality. This outcome, while noticeable, was not the primary focus of our project. Implementing a convolutional neural network for both the encoder and decoder could significantly enhance the aesthetic quality of these images.

## Conclusion <a id="conclusion" style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px; display: block;"></a>

In this project, we explored the application of amortized variational inference (A-VI) in Bayesian deep generative models, with a focus on closing the amortization gap between A-VI and traditional variational inference approaches such as factorized variational inference (F-VI) and constant variational inference. We conducted numerical experiments on benchmark imaging datasets, including MNIST, to compare the performance of A-VI with varying neural network architectures against F-VI and constant-VI.

Our findings demonstrated that A-VI, when implemented with sufficiently deep neural networks (hidden dimensions $\geq$ 64), was able to achieve the same evidence lower bound (ELBO) as F-VI after 5,000 epochs of training. Moreover, A-VI closed the gap in terms of reconstruction mean squared error (MSE) on both the training and test datasets. Importantly, A-VI proved to be 2 to 3 times computationally faster than F-VI, highlighting its efficiency in amortizing inference across the data by avoiding the need to estimate a different latent factor for each latent variable.

These results underscore the potential of A-VI in addressing the amortization interpolation problem, demonstrating that a deep encoder-decoder linear neural network with full Bayesian inference over the latent variables can effectively approximate the ideal inference function and close the amortization gap. The successful application of A-VI in this context paves the way for more efficient and scalable Bayesian deep generative models, enabling their deployment in various domains where computational efficiency and accurate inference are crucial.

Future research directions could involve exploring more complex neural network architectures, investigating the impact of different variational approximation families, and extending the application of A-VI to other types of generative models and datasets. Additionally, theoretical work on the conditions under which an ideal inference function is guaranteed to exist and the required richness of the inference function family could further deepen our understanding of the amortization interpolation problem and guide the development of more effective A-VI implementations.
